# Repo for solutions to CodeWars Katas that I have solved

Currently progressing and leveling up, as of Jan 2023, I am at 6KYU level.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** JavaScript

While these katas are avaialble for most languages, this repo will only contain JavaScript solutions.

## Optimizations

Without a doubt, my solutions to the majority of these katas can be optimized, I do not optimize the code I used to solve the kata so that I can track my progress. I do include some solutions that catch my eye after completing the problem and viewing others' solutions.

## Lessons Learned

Seeing the solutions to these problems that other people have come up with allows me to rethink the process I used to solve the issue. Often times I will learn new methods or different ways of structuring my code or more efficient code solutions that I can then use when working on projects and other katas.
