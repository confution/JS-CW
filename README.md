# Repo for solutions to CodeWars Katas that I have solved

Currently progressing and leveling up, as of Jan 2023, I am at 6KYU level.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** JavaScript

While these katas are avaialble for most languages, this repo will only contain JavaScript solutions.

## Optimizations

Without a doubt, my solutions to the majority of these katas can be optimized, I include others' solutions that catch my eye as well.

## Lessons Learned:

Always happy to learn new skills and seeing the other solutions to these problems that other people have come up with allows me to rethink the process I used to solve the issue. Often times I will learn new methods and more efficient code solutions.
